# Pharma_Spending_Pattern

This project analyzes pharmaceutical drug spending across OECD countries, highlighting significant variations in expenditure. By examining key metrics like per capita and total health spending, we aim to uncover different facets of healthcare financing. Our analysis identifies the top 5 most promising markets for pharmaceutical companies, with the U.S. currently leading in both per capita and total expenditure, indicating a substantial market opportunity. This insight assists pharmaceutical companies in strategically targeting countries with high spending capacity and market potential for drug sales.
