# Pharma_Spending_Pattern

This project analyzes pharmaceutical drug spending across OECD countries, highlighting significant variations in expenditure. By examining key metrics like per capita and total health spending, we aim to uncover different facets of healthcare financing. Our analysis identifies the top 5 most promising markets for pharmaceutical companies,

📝Project Overview: This project intends to identify potential new markets for pharmaceutical companies. The data on pharmaceutical drug spending across the OECD member countries will be examined to generate evidence for possible clients from major pharmaceutical companies and startups. Data Science approaches are employed to investigate the data from the OECD. The results will be presented in the form of visualization products, including a final report, presentation slides and dynamic visualization on the web.

📚Introduction and 🚨Problem Statement: A high-cost business is the nature of the pharmaceutical sector. The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by ever-increasing costs due to its industrial nature: i.e., High research and development costs, a need for high profits, monopoly tendencies, and an impact on patients. These sector-specific high-cost characteristics require continuous exploration of new drug markets. The need for effective and efficient strategies to identify a new drug market is a significant challenge for many pharmaceutical companies.

🏆Business Goal: This project intends to identify new markets for pharmaceutical companies by the data analysis and visualization. Through evidence-informed approaches, this project aims to identify potential new markets, using high pharmaceutical drug spending as a key indicator for decision-making. The intended objectives of this project are to identify potential new market countries in the form of:

- the top five (5) countries with the highest pharmaceutical drug spending 
- a group of countries with similar characteristics
- factors contributing to high pharmaceutical drug spending at the country level

Possible clients for this project include pharmaceutical stakeholders, both major companies and startups:
- Sales teams
- Executives

The project assumes these stakeholders are non-technical members of these companies and startups. 

🤖Data Science Approach: This project employs data science (DS) approaches. The data for this DS method come from pharmaceutical drug spending data by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Three primary methods are proposed: Time-series analysis, clustering and trend-analysis/predictive modelling. 

- Time-series analyses will examine Delta or the average of pharmaceutical drug spending over time across the OECD countries. The results will describe possible top spending countries with potential for continuous increase in their pharmaceutical drug spending.
- Clustering through K-means will group countries with similar characteristics, including pharmaceutical drug spending. The results will reveal potential characteristics of new market countries within the OECD membership.
- Predictive modelling through multiple regression analysis will forecast future trends or projections based on predictors in the dataset. 

Possible deliverables for this project are
- final report in README
- presentation slides
- semi-dynamic visualization on the web (HTML or other forms)

Due to the time limitations, the first two methods are this project's main DS approach. The third method will only be implemented should there be additional opportunities. 

📝 Conclusion: This evidence-informed DS project is ideal for solving the existing challenges of identifying new drug markets for global pharmaceutical companies. The target audience of this project is executives and sales teams from major pharmaceutical companies and startups. The DS approaches for this project will uncover the top five (5) countries, clustering characteristics and possible factors contributing to drug spending at the country level. The data from the OECD will be examined to achieve the business goal and project objectives. The project team will spend the next five (5) days devising, analyzing and disseminating the evidence and deliverables for potential pharmaceutical clients.
